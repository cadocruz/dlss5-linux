"""Widen core.pe's DX12 promotion to engine plugin folders.

Upstream only checks the exe's own folder for an Agility SDK or DLSS-G/RR.
Unreal keeps nvngx_dlssg.dll / nvngx_dlssd.dll under
Plugins/Runtime/Nvidia/**, so Stellar Blade came back "DX11". Under Proton
every DXGI game is vkd3d/dxvk anyway; what matters is the route list, and
native/upstream/optiscaler need the DX12 label.
