"""Proton-aware route policy on top of core.dlss.detect().

What we measured on this platform (RTX 50, proton-cachyos 11, Sept 2026):

* OptiScaler, y4my4m nightly line: `dlss: true` on every D3D12 game with
  DLSS (FF7 Rebirth, 007, Horizon), neural rendering on the game's own DLSS,
  HDR fine, no deadlock. The older Dagherbou builds either deadlocked
  (v0.2.x) or lost the NVAPI race and fell back to XeSS (v0.1.2). So the
  nightly makes upstream's own default -- OptiScaler on an RTX card -- the
  right one here too.
* D3D11 games WITH DLSS (Final Fantasy XIV): only OptiScaler works, through
  its dx11on12 bridge with `Dx11Upscaler=dlss_12`; the ReShade routes need a
  D3D12 device. The bridge needs vkd3d-proton's d3d12/d3d12core, which Proton
  only wires up on the Steam `run` path -- launchers that use umu
  `runinprefix` (XIVLauncher-RB) need `d3d12=n,b;d3d12core=n,b` added.
* D3D11 games WITHOUT DLSS: the feeder on a private D3D12 device (Dreamfall)
  works.
* D3D12 games WITHOUT DLSS: the feeder creates DLSS on the game's own device
  through ReShade's wrapper and that create faults non-deterministically
  inside vkd3d-proton (FF7 Remake, 11 of 15 launches). No proven route.
