"""Capcom's RE Engine: ReShade's add-on support is documented to crash it.

Not an anti-cheat in the usual sense - no BattlEye, no EAC - but the effect
on this tool is the same: the game can go down the instant ReShade (with
add-on support, which every route here needs) loads, worst on titles that
also carry Denuvo (Resident Evil Requiem). Community reports are consistent
across RE2/RE3/RE4 remakes, RE7, RE8 (Village) and Requiem; older titles are
sometimes fine, newer ones less so, and there is no reliable way to tell
from here which side of that line a given release falls on.

The fix, confirmed by players running ReShade with an add-on on Requiem
itself: REFramework loaded first. This tool installs it automatically for
any RE Engine game, before ReShade - see refw.py.

Detection is by the engine's own marker file rather than a name list, so it
covers a title nobody has told us about yet - the same reasoning as
anticheat.py.
