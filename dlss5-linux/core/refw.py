"""RE Engine (Capcom) support: REFramework, so ReShade does not crash it.

reengine.py explains the problem - RE Engine's own tamper checks kill ReShade
the instant it loads, add-on or no add-on. REFramework (praydog) is a
separate, actively maintained mod that installs itself as `dinput8.dll`,
loads before the game's own checks run, and patches around them - after
which ReShade loads normally (as `dxgi.dll`, unchanged) and survives.
Community reports on Resident Evil Requiem confirm ReShade with an add-on
staying up once REFramework is present, the same crash class this fixes.

Two REFramework release trains exist:
  - praydog/REFramework: tagged releases, one zip per game. Lags newer
    titles by a long way - Resident Evil Requiem (internal codename RE9)
    has no build there at all.
  - praydog/REFramework-nightly: a continuous build. Since some point in
    2026 it ships ONE universal `dinput8.dll` that detects the running
    game itself, covering RE9/Requiem along with everything older. This is
    the one that actually reaches the game people are asking about, so it
    is the one used here.
